        //What is an interface?
        //An interface is a programming tool that defines a set of methods for a class.

        //Why do you use interfaces?
        //Interfaces are used to include behavior from several sources within a class. 

        //How do we create interfaces?
        //Go to the files, right click with mouse, and then click 'Add'. and then, 'New Item', and click interface!

        //Interfaces can have Fields and Methods
        //Yes.

        //What must an interface field have to work?
        //Its name as well as type.

        //What must an interface method NOT have?
        //It cannot have implementations.

        //How do you call a Interface field?
        //(Guessing you mean how to call it into a field) You declare a field with an interface type and then assign it an object that implements that interface. C:


        //IEnumerable and IEnumerator

        //What loop does IEnumerable work with?
        //Foreach loop
    }
}
